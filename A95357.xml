            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE Enjoy the Unvaluable Bleſſing of a King, who is not only of the ſame Religion with Us, but who daily Expoſes himſelf to the greateſt Dangers for its Defence and Our Safety; all good Men had a juſt Senſe of this, on the happy Diſcovery of the late horrid Deſign of Aſſaſſination and Invaſion, and I wiſh, We may Show Our Gratitude to God as we ought for that Delivery; and in the next place that you chearfully imbrace this Opportunity of giving new Marks of Your Duty to the King; Who if He ſhould Require any thing from You for his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Uſes, I am perſwaded This Parliament would readily agree to it, but His Majeſty Deſires nothing from You, but that You take this occaſion to do every thing, that's neceſſar for Your Own and the Kingdoms Safety, in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all thats dear to Us from His and Our Enemies.</p>
            <p>I know You are ſo fully convinced of the Neceſſity there is of Supplies, for the Support of the Government and Maintainance of the Standing Forces, that I need not make Uſe of Arguments: Therefore I ſhall only mention what is neceſſar to be Provided, and is Expected from you by the King.</p>
            <p>The Fonds of the laſt Supplies are fallen ſo ſhort, that the Troops are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready much in Arear, and the late Deſigns againſt Us made it Remarkable, how ill. We were Provided of Arms and Ammunition, and that the Gariſons and Forts are much out of Repair.</p>

What was Appointed for Buying and Maintaining of Ships to Guard Our Coaſts, is alſo come to much leſs than was Imagined.</p>
            <p>What You give for theſe Ends, the King does Expect will be as large as You can, and in the moſt Equal and Eaſy Manner for the Country, and when the Recruits are wanted for Our Troops Abroad, that You take Care they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with as little Expence and Trouble as can be.</p>
            <p>It is Expected You will take the moſt Effectual Method for Putting the Kingdom in a Poſture of Defence, which may be a Means for Diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Our Enemies from Forming Deſigns to Diſturb Our preſent Quiet and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>I am Inſtructed to Paſs Acts for Suppreſſing of Profanity, and for Curbing of Vice: And it is Expected, what you do in this, may be made Effectual for obtaining the Ends, and that they be afterwards Impartially put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by thoſe of the Government. And I muſt tell you my Lords and Gentlemen, That your Sincere Endeavours and Example in this, will very much Recommend you to Our King.</p>
            <p>I am Allowed by His Majeſty to aſſure you, that He is Reſolved to Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Presbyterian Government in the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> And that it will be very acceptable to Him, that Difference amongſt Church-Men be Compoſed: And He particularly Recommends moderation in thoſe Matters.</p>
            <p>I am Allowed to give encouragement to Univerſities and Schools, which Laſt, are wanting in too many Places, eſpecially in the Highlands.</p>
            <p>I am alſo Impowered to Conſent to ſuch Laws, as ſhall be neceſſary for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing your Rights and Properties.</p>
            <p>This Seaſon of the Year, In which the Kings other Affairs hath Obliged Him to Call you, Does Require your Diligence in Putting an End to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs before you, as ſoon as poſſible you can. And I am Glad to have Ground to Hope, you will manage them with that Unanimity and Concord, which the King hath ſo often Recommended to you.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not Trouble you with what Concerns my ſelf, I am very Senſible of my Unfitneſs for the Weighty and Honourable Charge I bear: I can only ſay, That I Earneſtly Deſire, to be Inſtrumental in doing Service to my King and Countrey, and am very Confident of your Hearty Concurrence.</p>

               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur being again Called together, while our Soveraign Lord the King, is Abroad beyond Sea, is a new Proof of His Majeſties great Confidence in you, which no doubt, will be a ſtrong Obligation upon you, to Acquit your ſelves as Dutifully as if His Majeſty were preſent with you:</p>
            <p>This is our firſt Meeting, ſince it pleaſed the Almighty to give us a great Deliverance, by Diſcovering and Defeating the late Execrable and Helliſh Plot, and Conſpiracy, for Aſſaſſinating our King, and Invading his Kingdoms:</p>
            <p>That Signal Mercy of His Majeſties Preſervation, cannot but Enlarge our Hearts, in Thankfulneſs to GOD, in Love to our King, and in Reſolution and Vigilancy againſt His Enemies:</p>
            <p>It is an Ineſtimable Bleſſing, that GOD has ſet over us, and preſerves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, a King not only Profeſſing the Reform'd Religion, but who alſo is ſo Pious in the Practice, and ſo Zealous in the Defence of it:</p>
            <p>A King, who has given to this Nation, many Convincing, Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His Peculiar Favour towards it; And among others, that of Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Presbyterian Government in this Church, and giving us Aſſurance that He will Maintain it: Let our Prudence, Charity, and Moderation ever En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Him to do it:</p>
            <p>His Majeſty and His Kingdoms, have very Powerful Enemies, who with Mighty Armies, do what they can to continue the War: While they are ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, we are not to be Remiſs nor Secure:</p>
            <p>'Tis true this War, the greateſt that ever was in <hi>Europe,</hi> and wherein we are neceſſarly Ingag'd, is by the Bleſſing of GOD upon the Courage, and Conduct of our King, removed to ſuch a Diſtance, as that we the Subjects, know little of it, but by the News we hear: We live at Home, free from the Calamities which Afflict the Seat of a War; but at the ſame time, our King, our Deliverer Travels, and Watches by Day and by Night, Traverſes Sea and Land, Expoſes His Precious Life to Dangers, that we may be in Safety, that we may be at Eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:153697:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 110 -->
We are then to Conſider ſeriouſly what Stedable Service we can do to His Majeſty, in a Senſe of our Duty and Gratitude: and to ſet about it, with all Diligence and Unanimity.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioner's Grace has very ſuitably to his Character of Fidelity to the King, and Love to His Country, in His Majeſties Name Recommended to you Matters which highly concern the Kings Service, and the Countreys Intereſt, (the ſame thing in different Terms) ſo that I need to ſay little.</p>
            <p>But you know, there is a Neceſſity to Eſtabliſh a Fund ſufficient for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Forces kept in the Countrey, and for Maintaining the Forts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in a fit Condition.</p>
            <p>And becauſe, for ſparing the Kingdoms Expenſe, His Majeſty, does not keep ſo many Troops here, as might be Requiſite, for our Defence, in caſe any conſiderable Attempt from Abroad were made upon the Land. It is as neceſſary, that the Countrey be put in ſome better Poſture, and be better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Arms and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Settling an Effectual Method for Recruiting the Troops of this Nation which are Abroad, is one good mean, to keep the War at the diſtance it is; and nothing can more Encourage our Men to go common Souldiers, than that a good courſe be laid down, whereby they who Return diſabled from the Service, may be comfortably Maintained.</p>
            <p>The Trade of the Nation doth likeways Require your Care of Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Frigats for Guarding your Coaſts, and Convoying your Merchants.</p>
            <p>It is not to be Doubted, but you will gain time, every Conſideration preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you to it, and fall upon ſuitable Methods, to Anſwer His Majeſties Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation in theſe things: for you ſee how willing His Majeſty is to Aſſent to ſuch Laws, as are needful for ſecuring your Rights, and Properties; for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Piety and Vertue: for Suppreſſing Vice and Profanity, for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducating your Youth, in Knowledge and Learning: And indeed to do for you, whatever doth Tend to your Proſperity and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed to Turn your Thoughts to His Majeſties other Kingdoms, in the ſame Bottom with this; and Conſider the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that Wiſe, Magnanimous, and Powerful Nation, how Liberally, and Couragiouſly they have Acted, in Maintaining the common Cauſe, take an Encouragment of them, and let your Actings be of Encouragment to them.</p>
            <p>What you do, my Lords, and Gentlemen, in this your High Capacity, is uſually Expreſt by a very Becoming Name, it is Called the Kings Service, while to Speak it plainly, you are Conſulting, and Acting for your Selves; you Reap the Fruit; the Advantage is yours.</p>
            <p>How great a Happineſs is it, that what we do for our Selves, has ſuch a Vein of Love, and Fidelity to our King; incorporated with it, as makes it to Merit the Title of His Majeſties Service: And that our King as Father of the Countrey, is graciouſly pleaſed to Conſider the Good we do for our Selves, as the beſt Service we can do to Him: May it ever be thus, let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail on our Part, that as our King has been a Bleſſing from Heaven to us, ſo his Majeſty may have Reaſon to think, that His Loving and Dutiful Subjects, are the like to Him.</p>
